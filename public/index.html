                        <p>Chinese calligraphy, as one of the most appreciated artistic form in China, has a history of over 2000 years and is still in area of interest among people in east Asia and their descendants worldwide. The basic style of Chinese calligraphy, Kaishu(楷书), is where the training starts for anyone who wants to master the art. </p>
                        <p>Chinese calligraphers use paintbrushes made of wolf wool or other animal fur,   a special kind of black ink, and paper made of bamboo liner or another type of special grass. It’s not only an art form on its own, it is also an inseparable part of Chinese painting. It embodies the very essence of the "Eastern arts".  There are numerous brushing copies from ancient monuments with encrypted calligraphy. They remain the perfect textbook for people learning the different styles. There are also tons of books teaching from the introduction level to the more sophisticated styles. </p>

                        <p>Chinese languages have different origins. The most important ones belong to the Sinitic language group. The ancestral Han Chinese migrated from Burma as rice farmers. Linguists believe Sinitic languages are within the Tibeto-Burman language family. </p>
                        <p>Cantonese is spoken by people in Guangdong and Hong Kong. Cantonese originates from Han Dynasty.  Wu is spoken by people in Shanghai and Jiangsu and originates from Tang Dynasty. Mandarin was imported from Liaoning province following the founding of Qing Dynasty in the 17th century. Mandarin was spread throughout China after that. Even though Mandarin is ultimately a Sinitic language, it is heavily influenced by Altaic languages.</p>
