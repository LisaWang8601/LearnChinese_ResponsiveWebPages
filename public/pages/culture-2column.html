                        <h2>Chinese Religions</h2>
                        <br>
                 	    <p>There are three major religions in China, Confucianism, Taoism and Buddhism, though many would consider Confucianism more a set of philosophy than a religion. </p>
                 	    <h3>Buddhism </h3>
                        <img src="../images/budism3.jpg" alt="Buddhism" >
                        <p>Buddhism might have arrived in China as early as the third century BC because there was a history record that the Qin Emperor ordered to eliminate the religion about 213 BC.  Different forms of Buddhism evolved as it reached more of the population at various eras and by different spreading routes. The social and ethnical background in each area also affected the way each of them developed. Eventually Han, Tibetan and Southern Buddhism formed as distinguished practices and core beliefs.<br></p>
                        <h3>Taoism </h3>
                        <img src="../images/BaGua.jpg" alt="Taoism" >
                        <p>The word Tao in Chinese means "way," indicating a way of life or philosophy. In the 6th century BC, originated from the ideas of Lao-tzu, Taoism became "the way". Taoism speaks of a eternal Tao which is considered no name and impossible to fully known by human. It is the creating force and unifying element of all that is in the universe. Everything is basically one despite the manifestation in different forms. The life of an individual comes from the One and goes back into it.<br></p>
                        <h3>Confucianism</h3>
                        <img src="../images/kongzi_medium.jpg" alt="Confucianism" >
                        <p>Confucianism has influenced many aspects of Chinese culture. Confucius was the most famous Philosopher in Chinese history. He lived in the Zhou Dynasty. Turmoil and injustices were prevalent in the society at the time. Through visiting a few nations and teaching along the way, he developed a new moral code based on respect, education, kindness, integrity, and strong family bonds. His teachings gradually became the basis for religious and moral life throughout China. Confucius' words were recorded by his students in Lun Yu.</p>
                        <p>"Human natures are in common, but their habits carry them far apart."</p>
                        <p>"Forget injury. Never forget kindness."</p>

                        <p>The minority groups share China's vast lands but mostly live within their own communities. Some groups have their unique languages and even writing systems.</p>
                        <p>Many minority languages across the globe are in danger of extinction, according to linguists, as several “super languages” spread online and on television. The situation is the same to minority groups in China.</p>
                        <p>Many parents who speak minority languages themselves are not speaking enough of it to their children, hoping that their children will have better Mandarin skills and have a better chance of finding a good job in the future.</p>
                        <p>“I can speak it fluently, as can my family members. But my children can only say a few words. I speak to them in Chinese.” said Lei, a member from She Group in the province of Fujian.</p>

                        <p>According to the United Nations, She was classified as being close to extinction. Among 790,000 people, the current population, just 1,000 speakers of She. This language has no written form which makes it harder to preserve.</p>
