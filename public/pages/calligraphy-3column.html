                 	    <p>The Chinee calligraphy utilizes a variety of brushes in different material and sizes. The brush tips are mostly made of goat hair, wolf hair or the blend of the two, with softer goat hair on the outside and stiffer wolf hair inside. The brushes are similar with what are used in traditional Chinese painting. Some may think the style of calligraphy decides what kind of brushes is used, on the contrary, it is more dependent on what’s in the calligrapher’s mind and the taste and strength one possesses. </p>
                        <p>Tips: Soak the brushes in tepid water a few minutes to dissolve the adhesive protection before the first use. </p>

                        <p>To practice calligraphy people use a relatively coarse paper called Maobianzhi. It is made with grass. It is a yellowish colour. Its low cost makes us able to practice a lot without spend to much money.</p>

                        <p>To write it as an art from,  the same paper used for Chinese painting is used: Xuan Zhi (宣纸) made from grass. The absorbent type, Sheng Xuan (生宣) ， is the common one.</p>

                        <h2>The Ink and Ink Stone</h2>
                        <p>Traditional ink was molded into sticks. It is made of soot, glue and herbal substances. The soot was produced by burning spruce wood or other kinds of oil rich woods. The raw material separates the of inks.</p>
                        <p>The ink stick is rubbed with a little wter in an saucer carved in the ink stone. More rubbing makes thicker ink. Water can be added to obtain the various shades of the strokes.</p>

                        <p>Nowadays liquid ink is popular for its convenience. It is thick so need to be diluted to obtain the various shades needed. It is accepted by the majority of calligraphers, not even to mention the beginners.</p>
